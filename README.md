# Markov Random Field Depixelator

### Part A

For cs542, Machine Learning I implemented a image depixelator to clean up images. You can see the result below:

![Processed Image](results/final.png)
![Original Image](results/orig.png)

To run just run `hw5sol.m` in matlab.

I was able to get an accuracy of `97%` using the following params.

| h   | b   | n   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   |  5  |  2  |
